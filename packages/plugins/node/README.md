# @hugsylabs/plugin-node

Streamlined Node.js development support for Hugsy - focused on preventing real errors without being annoying.

## ‚ú® What's New (v0.1.0) - "The Less Annoying Edition"

- üéØ **Focused Protection** - Only prevents actual mistakes
- ü§´ **Much Quieter** - 80% less output, all messages are 1 line
- üö™ **Always Escapable** - Every check has a `--force` option
- üóëÔ∏è **Removed Annoyances** - No more auto-install, auto-lint, or "helpful" tips

## What It Actually Does Now

### ‚úÖ Keeps (The Good Stuff)

- **Changeset Branch Protection** - Prevents `changeset version` on wrong branch
- **Smart Package Manager Warning** - Only warns when lockfiles were recently changed
- **Missing Dependencies Check** - Tells you when node_modules is missing
- **Dependency Conflict Detection** - Warns about version mismatches in monorepos

### ‚ùå Removed (The Annoying Stuff)

- ~~Auto-install dependencies~~ - You know when to run npm install
- ~~Auto-lint on commit~~ - Use husky if you want this
- ~~Auto-test on push~~ - Again, use husky
- ~~Node version nagging~~ - .nvmrc already does this
- ~~Security audit spam~~ - npm already shows this
- ~~"Helpful" tips~~ - You don't need to be told to check for updates

## Installation

```bash
npm install @hugsylabs/plugin-node
```

## Usage

Add to your `.hugsyrc.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@hugsylabs/plugin-node"]
}
```

## Examples of the New Simplified Output

### Before vs After

**Changeset Protection:**

```bash
# Before: 15 lines of explanation
# After:
‚ùå changeset version requires main branch (use --force to override)
```

**Package Manager Detection:**

```bash
# Before: Warned every single time
# After: Only when lockfile was recently updated
‚ö†Ô∏è  pnpm-lock.yaml was recently updated, consider: pnpm install
```

**Missing Dependencies:**

```bash
# Before: Auto-installed without asking
# After: Simple reminder
‚ö†Ô∏è  Missing node_modules. Run: npm install
```

### Escape Hatches

Every protection can be bypassed when needed:

```bash
# Force changeset version on feature branch
pnpm changeset version --force

# Skip all checks with environment variables
HUGSY_SKIP=1 npm install
```

- ‚úÖ Warn about potential dependency conflicts
- ‚ùå Don't force you to lint/test (that's what CI is for)
- ‚ùå Don't auto-install things without asking
- ‚ùå Don't give unsolicited advice

## FAQ

**Q: How do I disable everything?**  
A: Don't use the plugin. Seriously, it's now minimal enough that if you don't want these protections, just don't install it.

**Q: Can I force changeset version on a feature branch?**  
A: Yes, use `pnpm changeset version --force`

**Q: Why doesn't it auto-install dependencies anymore?**  
A: Because that was annoying. You know when to run `npm install`.
